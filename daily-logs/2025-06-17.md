Title: Add paper layout tokens and preview
Note: Added `--page-margin-mobile` and `--page-margin-desktop` tokens, documented in style-tokens.md, created paper object style and updated Gallery FormStyleSection to render paper preview with responsive margins.

Time: 21:07
Title: Gallery Stylelint Smoke Check
Note: Ran stylelint on gallery layout component (gallery-layout.css); no issues found. Objects directory remains excluded per .stylelintignore. Gallery styles confirmed clean.

Time: 21:15
Title: Gallery Component ESLint Pass
Note: Ran ESLint on Gallery and GalleryLayout components. Removed redundant role attribute in GalleryDrawer to resolve accessibility error; remaining minor import-order warnings noted for future cleanup.

Time: 21:35
Title: Stylelint Autofix Applied
Note: Ran stylelint --fix across src/styles/\*_/_.css. Alphabetical-order issues auto-resolved. 8 remaining selector-class-pattern errors in checkbox.css (camelCase -> kebab-case) and 8 color-no-hex warnings in tooltip/colors tokens left for manual refactor.

Time: 21:39
Title: Stylelint Zero Errors Achieved
Note: Renamed BEM-style classes in checkbox and tooltip components to kebab-case; converted hex palette in \_colors.css to HSL. Re-ran stylelint across all styles – zero errors/warnings.
