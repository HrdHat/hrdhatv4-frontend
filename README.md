# HrdHat

## üéØ **Mission Statement**

HrdHat is a **tool for tradespeople** to efficiently complete daily safety forms, not a data analytics or reporting platform. Our focus is on making safety paperwork fast, intuitive, and reliable for construction workers in the field.

## What the project does

HrdHat webapp is a tool that helps tradespeople and crews create, fill out, store, view and submit daily safety form with is core form being the FLRA form (Field Level Risk Assessment form)

It provides a either a quickfill or guided, one-question-at-a-time experience then generates professional PDF outputs.

It supports mobile, tablet and desktop screens.

A core feacher will be the "recall" function, where a user can click the "recall" button to help intuitavly fill out out section of the form based on the users previous data that was filled out.

## üö´ **Explicit Do Nots - Keep Focus on Tradesperson Tool**

**‚ùå DO NOT ADD:**

- Complex reporting queries or dashboards
- Data analytics or trend analysis features
- Advanced search across form content
- Business intelligence or metrics
- Cross-form data aggregation
- Supervisor analytics dashboards
- Performance reporting systems
- Data export for analysis tools
- Cross-user data analysis
- Statistical analysis features

**‚ùå DO NOT OPTIMIZE FOR:**

- Complex SQL queries across forms
- Reporting performance
- Data warehouse integration
- Business analytics use cases
- Trend reporting
- Management dashboards

**‚úÖ DO FOCUS ON:**

- Fast form loading and saving
- Reliable device switching
- Offline form completion
- Quick PDF generation
- Simple form recall (Phase 2)
- User-specific form management
- Construction site usability
- Touch-first mobile experience
- Paper-like PDF output

## Project

## Why the project is useful

The goal is for this app to feel like a core "tool" for the daily safety paperwork by reducing the time spent filling out forms and making the intuitave

## Tech Stack

Front-end: React, Vite, TypeScript

Back-end: Supabase (Postgres + Edge Functions)

Storage: Supabase Storage for photos/signatures

Styling: ITCSS,

PDF: html2pdf or Puppeteer

DevOps: GitHub Actions (build, lint, deploy), Docker (local Supabase emulation)

#Getting Started

Prerequisites (Node, npm/yarn, Supabase project)

Quick-start install & run

## Configuration

.env variables you need (VITE_SUPABASE_URL, anon key, etc.)

Optional Docker setup for local DB

## Git Workflow & Repository Structure

### Repository Organization

HrdHat uses a **multi-repository architecture**:

```
Hrdhatv4/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/    # This repository (React app)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/     # Separate repository (Supabase functions/schemas)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cursor/     # Global Cursor IDE configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .vscode/     # Global VS Code configuration
```

### Important Git Rules

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Each directory has its own git repository**

- `frontend/` ‚Üí `https://github.com/HrdHat/hrdhatv4-frontend.git`
- `backend/` ‚Üí `https://github.com/HrdHat/hrdhat4-backend.git`
- Root directory (`Hrdhatv4/`) is **NOT** a git repository

### Automated Git Workflow

Both frontend and backend repositories include automated git scripts:

#### Quick Usage

```bash
# Option 1: Auto-timestamp commit
./git-auto-push.sh

# Option 2: Custom commit message
./git-auto-push.sh "your commit message"

# Option 3: Windows batch version
git-auto-push.bat "your commit message"

# Option 4: Use Cursor snippet
# Type @git-auto-push in Cursor, then say "run git auto-push"
```

#### Automation Features

- ‚úÖ **Retry Logic**: 5 attempts with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ **Conflict Resolution**: Auto-fetches and rebases remote changes
- ‚úÖ **Safety Checks**: Validates repository and checks for changes
- ‚úÖ **Color Output**: Status messages for easy debugging
- ‚úÖ **Zero Disruption**: Guarantees completion or safe failure

#### What the Automation Does

1. Validates you're in a git repository
2. Checks for uncommitted changes
3. Fetches and rebases remote changes if needed
4. Stages all changes (`git add .`)
5. Commits with your message (or auto-timestamp)
6. Pushes to current branch with retry logic

### Manual Git Workflow

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Standard git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin master

# Check status
git status
git log --oneline
```

### Working Across Repositories

When working on features that span frontend and backend:

1. **Make frontend changes** in `frontend/` directory
2. **Commit and push** from `frontend/` directory
3. **Switch to backend** directory: `cd ../backend`
4. **Make backend changes** in `backend/` directory
5. **Commit and push** from `backend/` directory

#### Example Workflow

```bash
# Working on authentication feature
cd frontend/
# ... make frontend changes ...
./git-auto-push.sh "Add login form UI"

cd ../backend/
# ... make backend changes ...
./git-auto-push.sh "Add authentication endpoints"
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **DON'T** create git repositories in the root `Hrdhatv4/` directory
‚ùå **DON'T** try to commit both frontend and backend changes together
‚ùå **DON'T** work in the wrong directory when making commits

‚úÖ **DO** always check your current directory before committing
‚úÖ **DO** use the automated scripts for consistent workflow
‚úÖ **DO** commit frontend and backend changes separately

### Troubleshooting Git Issues

If you encounter git problems:

1. **Check your location**: `pwd` (should be in `frontend/` or `backend/`)
2. **Check git status**: `git status`
3. **Remove lock files**: `rm -f .git/index.lock` (if git operations hang)
4. **Use automation**: The scripts handle most edge cases automatically

## Testing & Quality

### Code Quality Tools

This project uses a comprehensive set of tools to maintain code quality and consistency:

- **ESLint**: TypeScript/React linting with custom naming conventions and architectural rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Linting
npm run lint              # Check for linting errors
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix linting errors where possible

# Formatting
npm run format            # Format all files with Prettier
npm run format:check      # Check if files are properly formatted

# Type Checking
npm run type-check        # Run TypeScript compiler without emitting files

# Development
npm run dev               # Start development server
npm run build             # Build for production
```

### Naming Conventions (Enforced by ESLint)

Our codebase follows strict naming conventions:

- **Files & Folders**: `kebab-case` for folders, `PascalCase.tsx` for components
- **Interfaces/Types**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `FormInstance`, `UserData`)
- **Functions**: `camelCase` or `PascalCase` (for React components)
- **Variables**: `camelCase`, `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- **Properties**: `camelCase` with semicolons in TypeScript interfaces

### Architectural Rules (Enforced by ESLint)

The project enforces a clean architecture with these rules:

1. **No Cross-Feature Imports**: Features must remain independent
2. **Unidirectional Architecture**: `Shared ‚Üí Features ‚Üí App`
3. **Import Organization**: Automatic sorting and grouping

```
‚úÖ Allowed Import Flow:
Shared Components (components/, hooks/, lib/, types/, utils/)
    ‚Üì
Features (features/*)
    ‚Üì
App (app/*)
```

### IDE Integration

**VS Code** users get automatic:

- Format on save
- ESLint error fixing on save
- Import organization
- TypeScript error highlighting

**Recommended Extensions**:

- ESLint
- Prettier - Code formatter
- TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit/Integration tests (when implemented)
npm run test
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage
```

## Deployment

How the live site/API is deployed (e.g., Supabase, Vercel)

## Contributing & Support

### Code Quality Requirements

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

1. `npm run lint` passes without errors
2. `npm run format:check` passes
3. `npm run type-check` passes
4. Follow the established naming conventions
5. Respect architectural boundaries (no cross-feature imports)
