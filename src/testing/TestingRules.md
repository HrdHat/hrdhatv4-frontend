# Testing Directory Rules

## Purpose

Contains test utilities, mocks, and shared testing configurations.

## Guidelines

- Provide reusable testing utilities and helpers
- Create consistent mocks for external dependencies
- Maintain test data factories and fixtures
- Configure testing environments and setups
- Follow testing best practices and patterns

## Structure

- `mocks/` - Mock implementations for APIs, libraries, etc.
- `fixtures/` - Test data and fixtures
- `utils/` - Testing utility functions and helpers
- `setup/` - Test environment configuration
- `factories/` - Data factories for generating test data

## Best Practices

- Write clear and maintainable tests
- Use proper test isolation and cleanup
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Use descriptive test names and descriptions
- Implement proper test coverage
- Use testing libraries consistently
- Create reusable test utilities
- Follow the testing pyramid principle
- Use proper assertions and matchers
- Implement proper async testing patterns
