      HrdHat helps tradespeople complete daily safety paperwork quickly and
      reliably. The web app lets crews create, fill out, store, view, and submit
      Field Level Risk Assessment (FLRA) forms. Designed for mobile, tablet, and
      desktop screens, it offers both quick-fill and guided,
      one-question-at-a-time experiences. A recall function pre-populates
      repetitive data to save time. The goal is to make safety paperwork feel
      like a core tool, not a burden.
