# Application Overview

HrdHat lets users sign up, create, and manage daily safety formsâ€”chiefly the FLRA (Field-Level Risk Assessment).

We have a form structure and every form is built of form modules(sections).

## Data model

The application contains the following models:

- User - can have one of these roles:

  - `USER` - can:
    - edit own profile
    - create/fill out/access/stave/submit Forms:
      - Create
      - Fill out
      - Access Active and Archived form
      - Modify Active Forms
      - Generate Pdf
      - Modify what modules a user wants in there forms.
    - edit what modules are part of what form. (This is a phase 2)
