# Security

## Auth & Authorization in HrdHat (Supabase + RLS)

### Authentication

In HrdHat, all authentication is managed via **Supabase Auth**.

- **User Registration**: Users sign up with First Name, Last Name, Company, and Email
- **Automated Handling**: Supabase handles email confirmation, password resets, and session tokens automatically
- **SDK Integration**: The app uses the Supabase client SDK (`@supabase/supabase-js`) for all auth flows‚Äîno manual token handling required

#### Token Storage

- **Automatic Management**: Supabase automatically stores the session token securely (using localStorage)
- **No Manual Handling**: There's no need to manage tokens or cookies manually; the Supabase client handles refresh and expiration
- **Session Restoration**: On app reload, the Supabase client restores the session if the token is present

#### XSS Protection

- **Input Sanitization**: Always sanitize any user-generated HTML or markdown before rendering it in the UI
- **Trusted Libraries**: Use trusted libraries (e.g. DOMPurify) to avoid XSS attacks

### Handling User Data (Frontend State)

- **Global Access**: The authenticated user object is available globally through Supabase's client (`supabase.auth.getUser()` or `useUser` hook)
- **State Management**: User state should be available to any component via React context or your preferred state library
- **Security**: No sensitive data is ever stored outside the Supabase session

### Authorization

**Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS)** enforces all backend permissions:

- **Table Policies**: Every table (e.g., `form_instances`) has policies that restrict access based on `auth.uid()`
- **Client-Side Protection**: Even if a user manipulates the client, RLS prevents unauthorized access, changes, or reads
- **Database-Level Security**: True security enforcement happens at the database level

#### Example RLS Policy

```sql
-- Only allow users to read or update forms where created_by = auth.uid()
-- Admin/Supervisor roles (if needed) can be handled with a role field and RLS logic
```

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Permission-Based Access Control (PBAC)

- **Role Storage**: User roles (e.g., `USER`, `SUPERVISOR`, `ADMIN`) can be stored as custom claims in Supabase or in the user profile table
- **RLS Integration**: Use these roles in your RLS policies to control resource access at the database level
- **Frontend vs Backend**: The frontend may display or hide features, but the backend always enforces actual permissions

## Implementation Examples

### Frontend Auth Flow

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);

// Sign up
const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email,
  password,
  options: {
    data: { firstName, lastName, company },
  },
});

// Sign in
const { user, session, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email,
  password,
});

// Get current user (anywhere in app)
const user = supabase.auth.getUser();
```

### RLS Policy for form_instances

```sql
-- Only allow a user to access their own forms
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own forms"
ON form_instances
FOR SELECT
USING (created_by = auth.uid());

-- Only allow a user to update their own forms
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own forms"
ON form_instances
FOR UPDATE
USING (created_by = auth.uid());
```

## Best Practices Checklist

### ‚úÖ Security Requirements

- [ ] All backend data access is protected with Supabase RLS
- [ ] Never trust client-only checks for security
- [ ] Frontend only displays features based on user roles/permissions, but RLS is the true gatekeeper
- [ ] Use the Supabase session for all authentication logic‚Äîdo not roll your own JWT/cookie handling
- [ ] Always sanitize user input/output in the UI to prevent XSS
- [ ] Audit RLS policies after every schema change or new feature

### üîç Regular Security Audits

1. **RLS Policy Review**: Verify all tables have appropriate row-level security policies
2. **Permission Testing**: Test user access with different roles and permissions
3. **XSS Prevention**: Review all user input handling and output rendering
4. **Session Management**: Ensure proper session handling and logout functionality

### üõ°Ô∏è Frontend Security Measures

```typescript
// Example: Sanitizing user input
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const sanitizedContent = DOMPurify.sanitize(userGeneratedContent);

// Example: Role-based UI rendering
const UserDashboard = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const userRole = user?.user_metadata?.role;

  return (
    <div>
      {userRole === 'ADMIN' && <AdminPanel />}
      {userRole === 'SUPERVISOR' && <SupervisorTools />}
      <UserForms />
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Testing in HrdHat

Testing in HrdHat is built for **real-world reliability**‚Äînot just code coverage. Our priority is integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests that reflect actual user workflows, while unit tests catch errors in shared logic and components early.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

**Purpose**: Validate individual utility functions, React components, and shared hooks in isolation.

**Examples in HrdHat**:

- Form field validation functions
- Utility helpers (e.g. date formatting, debounce logic)
- Rendering a single input field/component

**Tool**: Vitest (works out of the box with Vite/React)

**File location**: Place alongside code, e.g. `FormField.test.tsx`

```typescript
// Example: Unit test for form validation
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { validateFormField } from './formValidation';

describe('validateFormField', () => {
  it('should validate required fields', () => {
    expect(validateFormField('', true)).toBe('This field is required');
    expect(validateFormField('value', true)).toBe(null);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Ensure multiple components, hooks, or services work together as expected.

**Examples in HrdHat**:

- Full form modules rendering with their metadata/state
- Hook + service interaction for fetching/saving form data (mocking Supabase JSONB responses)
- Testing the complete fill and save flow for a module, including error boundaries

**Tool**: Vitest + React Testing Library

**File location**: `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` in same directory or `__tests__` subfolders

```typescript
// Example: Integration test for form module
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { FormModule } from './FormModule';

describe('FormModule Integration', () => {
  it('should save form data when submitted', async () => {
    const mockSave = vi.fn();
    render(<FormModule onSave={mockSave} />);

    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText('Risk Level'), { target: { value: 'High' } });
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Save'));

    expect(mockSave).toHaveBeenCalledWith({
      modules: { riskAssessment: { riskLevel: 'High' } }
    });
  });
});
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Purpose**: Simulate real user flows across frontend and backend.

**Examples in HrdHat**:

- User creates an account, fills out a new FLRA, saves
- Switches devices and resumes form
- Supervisor review and PDF export

**Tool**: Playwright or Cypress (Playwright recommended for React/Supabase integration)

**Run location**: CI pipeline or before major releases

```typescript
// Example: E2E test for FLRA lifecycle
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('FLRA complete lifecycle', async ({ page }) => {
  // User creates account and logs in
  await page.goto('/login');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'user@example.com');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'password');
  await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');

  // Creates new FLRA form
  await page.click('[data-testid="new-flra"]');
  await page.fill('[data-testid="project-name"]', 'Test Project');

  // Fills out risk assessment
  await page.selectOption('[data-testid="risk-level"]', 'High');
  await page.click('[data-testid="save-form"]');

  // Verifies form is saved
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="save-success"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Recommended Tooling

### Primary Testing Stack

- **Vitest**: Fast, modern, seamless with Vite + React. Use for all unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library**: Simulate user interaction in integration tests
- **Playwright**: For full E2E coverage (recommended over Cypress for React/Supabase integration)

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Unit and Integration Tests
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage     # Run tests with coverage report

# E2E Tests
npm run test:e2e          # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ui       # Run E2E tests with UI mode
```

## Best Practices for HrdHat

### üéØ Test Priorities

1. **Integration tests for critical user journeys**: starting/saving a form, auto-archive, device switch, supervisor review
2. **Unit test complex helpers** and shared logic
3. **E2E tests should mirror user workflows** and edge cases: network failure during save, device switch, PDF export

### üìä JSONB-Specific Testing

**Always mock Supabase with JSON-shaped data**:

- Shape mocked responses as `{ modules: { ... } }` to match your real JSONB backend

```typescript
// Example: Mocking Supabase JSONB response
const mockFormData = {
  id: '123',
  modules: {
    riskAssessment: {
      riskLevel: 'High',
      mitigationSteps: ['PPE required', 'Safety briefing'],
    },
    workDetails: {
      projectName: 'Test Project',
      location: 'Site A',
    },
  },
};
```

**Assert on real data**:

- Check that the correct module keys/values are present in loaded/saved JSON, not just UI state

**E2E Flow**:

- Fill, save, reload, verify‚Äîthat's the real flow to test

### üìÅ File Organization

- Keep test files close to code
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Run all tests on every commit in CI for fast, constant feedback

### Example Test File Names

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ useFlraFormData.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ useFlraFormData.test.ts        # Integration test for form data hook
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FormToolbar.tsx
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FormToolbar.test.tsx           # Unit test for toolbar component
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ flra-lifecycle.spec.ts         # E2E: from form creation to archive
```

## Summary

HrdHat relies on Supabase's built-in authentication and RLS for bulletproof backend security. The frontend consumes the authenticated session, manages user state, and exposes features accordingly‚Äîbut the database always enforces true access control.

**Key Points:**

- No manual token or cookie logic is required beyond what Supabase provides
- Always keep XSS prevention and RLS audits in mind for every update
- Frontend security is about UX; backend security (RLS) is about actual protection
- Regular security audits ensure ongoing protection as the application evolves
