# Chapter 1: Project Setup & Architecture - Development Checklist

## Phase 1.1: Project Foundation & TypeScript Setup (Days 1-2)

### Vite + TypeScript Configuration

- [x] ✅ **COMPLETE**: Vite project initialized with TypeScript
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETE**: TypeScript configuration optimized for React development
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETE**: ESLint and Prettier configured for code quality
- [x] ✅ **COMPLETE**: Configure absolute imports with `@/` path mapping
- [x] Set up development environment variables
- [x] Configure build optimization for production

### Project Structure Setup

- [x] Set up `frontend/src/features/` directory structure
  - See `frontend/src/features/FeaturesRules.md` for canonical documentation and rules for this directory.
- [x] Create `frontend/src/components/` for shared components
  - See `frontend/src/components/ComponentsRules.md` for canonical documentation and rules for this directory.
- [x] Set up `frontend/src/hooks/`, `frontend/src/utils/`, `frontend/src/types/`
  - See `frontend/src/hooks/HooksRules.md`, `frontend/src/utils/UtilsRules.md`, and `frontend/src/types/TypesRules.md` for canonical documentation and rules for these directories.
- [x] Configure ITCSS styling structure in `frontend/src/styles/`
  - See `frontend/src/styles/stylerules.md` for canonical ITCSS methodology, directory structure, and styling rules.
- [x] ✅ Create testing directory structure
  - Testing directory and subfolders (`mocks/`, `fixtures/`, `utils/`, `setup/`, `factories/`) created in `src/testing/` with README.md documentation in each.

### Essential Dependencies

- [x] ✅ Install Zustand for state management
- [x] Install DOMPurify for XSS protection
- [x] ✅ Install Supabase client
- [x] Install Vitest and React Testing Library
- [x] Configure all development dependencies

## Phase 1.2: Routing Architecture Implementation (Days 3-4)

### Routing Implementation (React Router v6+)

- [x] Install React Router v6+ (`react-router-dom`)
- [x] Configure React Router in `App.tsx`
- [x] Define route structure using `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components
- [x] Implement browser history support (handled by React Router)
- [x] Implement URL parameter handling for form IDs and modes (handled by React Router)
- [x] Add protected route logic for authentication (using wrapper components or hooks)

### Route Structure Implementation

- [x] Implement Dashboard route (`/`)
  > **Evidence:** `LoggedinHomePage.tsx` exists and is routed for `/` in `router.tsx`.
- [x] Implement FormEditor route (`/form/:id`)
  > **Evidence:** `FormEditor.tsx` exists and is routed for `/form/:id` in `router.tsx`.
- [x] Implement Guided mode route (`/form/:id/guided`)
  > **Evidence:** `GuidedEditor.tsx` exists and is routed for `/form/:id/guided` in `router.tsx`.
- [x] Implement ArchivedForms route (`/archived`)
  > **Evidence:** `ArchivedFormsList.tsx` exists and is accessible via `SidebarLoggedIn` and routed in `router.tsx`.
- [x] Implement Profile route (`/profile`)
  > **Evidence:** `Profile.tsx` exists and is routed for `/profile` in `router.tsx`.
- [x] Implement Auth routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`)
  > **Evidence:** `Login.tsx` and `Signup.tsx` exist and are routed for `/auth/login` and `/auth/signup` in `router.tsx`.

### Navigation Components

- [-] Implement navigation components for each breakpoint _(Moved to Chapter 3: Core UI Components & Design System in appplansteps.md)_
- [] Add deep linking support for form editing states (handled by React Router)
- [Redacted] ~~Create route transition handling (with animation library if needed)~~

> **Note:** The navigation component implementation and responsive layout tasks have been moved to Chapter 3 (Core UI Components & Design System) in appplansteps.md to better align with project structure and design system focus.
