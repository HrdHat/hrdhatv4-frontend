# Chapter 1: Security Verification Checklist

## üîí Security Foundation Setup

### Development Environment Security

- [ ] Environment variables properly configured (.env not in git)
- [ ] Development dependencies scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in configuration files
- [ ] Secure defaults in TypeScript configuration
- [ ] ESLint security rules configured

### Input Sanitization Foundation

- [ ] DOMPurify installed and configured
- [ ] XSS protection utilities created
- [ ] Input validation framework established
- [ ] Secure coding standards documented
- [ ] Security review process defined

### Build Security

- [ ] Build process creates secure bundles
- [ ] No sensitive information in production builds
- [ ] Source maps properly configured (dev only)
- [ ] Bundle analysis shows no security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Production build tested for security issues

### Dependency Security

- [ ] All dependencies from trusted sources
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan passed
- [ ] Security-focused dependencies installed (DOMPurify)
- [ ] Package-lock.json committed for dependency consistency
- [ ] Regular dependency update process defined

## üõ°Ô∏è Architecture Security

### Routing Security

- [ ] Route protection framework established
- [ ] No sensitive data in URL parameters
- [ ] Route validation prevents unauthorized access
- [ ] Navigation state doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Deep linking security considered

### State Management Security

- [ ] Zustand stores don't persist sensitive data
- [ ] localStorage usage follows security best practices
- [ ] State management includes security boundaries
- [ ] Store data validation implemented
- [ ] State cleanup on logout/session end

### TypeScript Security

- [ ] Strict TypeScript mode prevents unsafe operations
- [ ] Type definitions include security constraints
- [ ] No `any` types that could bypass security
- [ ] Interface definitions include validation rules
- [ ] Type safety prevents injection vulnerabilities

## üîç Security Testing

### Static Analysis

- [ ] ESLint security rules passing
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode enabled
