## Phase 1.2: Routing Architecture Implementation (Days 3-4)

### Routing Implementation (React Router v6+)

- [x] Install React Router v6+ (`react-router-dom`)
- [x] Configure React Router in `App.tsx`
- [ ] Define route structure using `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components
- [ ] Implement browser history support (handled by React Router)

- [ ] Add protected route logic for authentication (using wrapper components or hooks)

### Route Structure Implementation

- [ ] Implement Dashboard route (`/`)
- [ ] Implement FormEditor route (`/form/:id`)
- [ ] Implement Guided mode route (`/form/:id/guided`)

- [ ] Implement Auth routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`)

### Navigation Components

- [ ] Implement navigation components for each breakpoint
- [ ] Add deep linking support for form editing states (handled by React Router)
- [ ] Create route transition handling (with animation library if needed)

## Phase 1.3: State Management Architecture (Days 5-6)

### Zustand Store Setup

- [ ] Create `useFormStore` for form data management
- [ ] Implement `useAuthStore` for user authentication
- [ ] Set up `useOfflineStore` for offline queue management
- [ ] Configure store persistence with localStorage

### Store Implementation

- [ ] Implement FormState interface with type safety
- [ ] Implement NavigationState interface
- [ ] Create store persistence logic
- [ ] Add store hydration and dehydration
- [ ] Implement store debugging tools

## Phase 1.4: Development Workflow & Quality Setup (Day 7)

### Code Quality Tools

- [ ] Configure ESLint rules for architectural boundaries
- [ ] Set up Prettier with format-on-save
- [ ] Configure TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Set up import organization rules
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks configuration

### Development Scripts

- [ ] Configure development scripts in package.json
- [ ] Set up build and preview scripts
- [ ] Configure linting and formatting scripts
- [ ] Add type checking scripts
- [ ] Set up test scripts

### Testing Foundation

- [ ] Set up Vitest for unit testing
- [ ] Configure React Testing Library
- [ ] Create test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting
- [ ] Add testing scripts to package.json

### Documentation Setup

- [ ] Create component documentation standards
- [ ] Set up API documentation structure
- [ ] Create development guidelines
- [ ] Document architectural decisions
- [ ] Set up changelog structure

## âœ… Phase Completion Verification

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

- [ ] Project builds without errors
- [ ] All routes accessible and functional
- [ ] State management working across components
- [ ] Development workflow efficient
- [ ] Code quality standards enforced

Preparation complete. Hereâ€™s what I found and what needs to be done:
Current State
Auth State:
Managed by Zustand (useAuthStore).
Provider (provider.tsx) syncs Supabase Auth to Zustand on mount and on auth state changes.
Login/Signup Forms:
Present, but both have // TODO: Call login/signup logic here and do not actually call the store or route on success.
Routing:
All routes currently render the "logged out" sidebar and login/signup forms.
There are no routes or logic for the logged in experience (SidebarLoggedIn, LoggedinHomePage) yet.
No conditional rendering based on auth state.
What Needs to Happen
Wire up login and signup forms:
Call useAuthStore.getState().login and signup on submit.
On success, route to / (dashboard).
Update router to support logged in experience:
If authenticated, render SidebarLoggedIn and LoggedinHomePage.
If not, render the current logged out experience.
Minimal implementation:
Only wire up enough to show SidebarLoggedIn and LoggedinHomePage after login/signup.
No extra features or UI polish.
Implementation Plan
Login.tsx / Signup.tsx
Call the appropriate auth store method on submit.
On success, use navigate('/') to go to the dashboard.
router.tsx
Add logic to check useAuthStore(state => state.user).
If user is present, render a route tree with SidebarLoggedIn and LoggedinHomePage.
If not, render the current logged out sidebar and forms.
Ready to implement this minimal login/signup-to-logged-in wiring.
Would you like to review this plan or should I proceed with the code changes?
