### Route Structure Implementation

- [ ] Implement Dashboard route (`/`)
- [ ] Implement FormEditor route (`/form/:id`)
- [ ] Implement Guided mode route (`/form/:id/guided`)
- [ ] Implement ArchivedForms route (`/archived`)
- [ ] Implement Profile route (`/profile`)
- [ ] Implement Auth routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`)

### Navigation Components

- [ ] Create `useNavigation` hook for route management
- [ ] Implement navigation components for each breakpoint
- [ ] Add deep linking support for form editing states
- [ ] Create route transition handling

## Phase 1.3: State Management Architecture (Days 5-6)

### Zustand Store Setup

- [ ] Create `useFormStore` for form data management
- [ ] Implement `useAuthStore` for user authentication
- [ ] Create `useNavigationStore` for routing state
- [ ] Set up `useOfflineStore` for offline queue management
- [ ] Configure store persistence with localStorage

### Store Implementation

- [ ] Implement FormState interface with type safety
- [ ] Implement NavigationState interface
- [ ] Create store persistence logic
- [ ] Add store hydration and dehydration
- [ ] Implement store debugging tools

## Phase 1.4: Development Workflow & Quality Setup (Day 7)

### Code Quality Tools

- [ ] Configure ESLint rules for architectural boundaries
- [ ] Set up Prettier with format-on-save
- [ ] Configure TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Set up import organization rules
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks configuration

### Development Scripts

- [ ] Configure development scripts in package.json
- [ ] Set up build and preview scripts
- [ ] Configure linting and formatting scripts
- [ ] Add type checking scripts
- [ ] Set up test scripts

### Testing Foundation

- [ ] Set up Vitest for unit testing
- [ ] Configure React Testing Library
- [ ] Create test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Set up coverage reporting
- [ ] Add testing scripts to package.json

### Documentation Setup

- [ ] Create component documentation standards
- [ ] Set up API documentation structure
- [ ] Create development guidelines
- [ ] Document architectural decisions
- [ ] Set up changelog structure
