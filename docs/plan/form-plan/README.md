# Form Plan Documentation

## Module Classification: Simple vs. Complex

In HrdHat, form modules are classified as either **Simple** or **Complex** based on their rendering and logic requirements:

- **Simple Modules**: Use standard rendering (text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.) and do not require custom logic. These modules are straightforward, reusable, and have no dependencies on user profile or dynamic data.
- **Complex Modules**: Require custom rendering and/or logic. These modules may interact with user profile data, generate hidden metadata, handle dynamic arrays, or have advanced UI/UX requirements. Examples include: FormHeader (metadata), General Information (user profile integration), PhotosModule, SignaturesModule, and Task Hazard Control Module.

## Purpose of This Folder

This folder contains all documentation and specifications related to form operation in HrdHat, including:

- How forms load and operate per user
- Logic and workflow for form handling
- Field definitions for all modules (Simple and Complex)
- User-specific behaviors and data flows
- Guidelines for module development and integration

All form-related logic, field specifications, and operational details will be maintained here to ensure clarity and consistency across the project.
