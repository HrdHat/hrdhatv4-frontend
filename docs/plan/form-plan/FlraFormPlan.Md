# FLRA: Field Level Risk Assessment ‚Äî Form Definition

**Status:** Implementation Ready  
**Last Updated:** Thu, Jun 5, 2025  
**Cross-References:** [FormSAMPLE.html], [Photo Module Specification], [Form Versioning & Definition Management Plan]

---

## üéØ Purpose

The FLRA form is the core safety form in HrdHat, used daily by field crews to assess and document site risks, controls, and compliance. It is composed of modular, versioned blocks as per project standards.

- See [Form Plan Documentation] for full metadata field list.
- Includes: unique key, created/updated timestamps, status, created_by, last_modified_by, formDefinitionId, formDefinitionVersion, audit trail, org/project IDs, submission timestamp, etc.

### 2. **Form Header** (Display)

- **Logo**: Organization/project logo.
- **Full Form Name**: "Field Level Risk Assessment (FLRA)".
- **Form Number**: Auto-generated, editable ([YYYYMMDD]-[NN]).

#### **D. Task, Hazard, Control (THC) Module** (Custom Render: Dynamic Table)

Each entry:
| Field Key | Label | Type | Required | helperText1 | helperText2 |
|--------------|-------------|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| task | Task | string | false | "Describe the task." | "Be specific about the activity." |
| hazard | Hazard | string | false | "Identify the hazard." | "List all potential hazards for this task." |
| hazard_risk | Hazard Risk | integer | false | "Risk level before controls." | "Use the risk matrix provided." |
| control | Control | string | false | "Describe the control measure." | "What will you do to reduce risk?" |
| control_risk | Control Risk | integer | false | "Risk level after controls." | "Use the risk matrix provided." |

> **Note:** Helper texts for dynamic table rows are defined at the field level and reused for each entry. If unique guidance is needed per row, the renderer will provide context-specific helper text.

_Note: This module requires a custom renderer for dynamic rows and risk selectors._

#### **E. Photos Module** (Custom Render, Separate Table Storage)

**Storage Architecture:**

```typescript
photos: Array<string>; // Array of form_photos.id references (UUIDs)
```

**Database Storage:**

- **Table**: `form_photos` stores metadata and Supabase Storage references
- **File Storage**: Photo files stored in Supabase Storage (max 5MB per photo)
- **Constraints**: Maximum 5 photos per form (enforced in frontend)
- **Fields**: id (uuid), form_instance_id, storage_path, file_size, uploaded_at, caption

**Photo Upload Process:**

1. User selects/captures photo ‚Üí Upload to Supabase Storage
2. Create record in `form_photos` table with storage reference
3. Add photo record ID to form JSONB `photos` array

#### **F. Signature and Confirmation** (Custom Render, Separate Table Storage)

**Storage Architecture:**

```typescript
signatures: Array<string>; // Array of form_signatures.id references (UUIDs)
```

**Database Storage:**

- **Table**: `form_signatures` stores metadata and Supabase Storage references
- **File Storage**: Signature images stored as PNG files in Supabase Storage (max 100KB per signature)
- **Flexible Roles**: `signer_role` field supports worker, supervisor, foreman, safety_officer, management, etc.
- **Legacy Support**: `signer_type` field maintained for backwards compatibility (worker/supervisor)
- **Immutable Records**: Signatures CANNOT be deleted once created (audit compliance)
- **Fields**: id (uuid), form_instance_id, signer_type, signer_role, signer_name, storage_path, file_size, signed_at

**Signature Capture Process:**

1. User draws signature on canvas ‚Üí Convert to PNG
2. Upload PNG to Supabase Storage
3. Create record in `form_signatures` table with storage reference and signer details
4. Add signature record ID to form JSONB `signatures` array

**Validation Rules:**

- ‚úÖ **NO SIGNATURES REQUIRED** for form submission (all signatures are optional)
- Multiple workers and supervisors can sign the same form
- Each signature is immutable once captured for audit compliance

_Note: This module requires a custom renderer for signature pads and dynamic signer management._

| Photos                    | custom      | See photo-module-specification |
| Signature & Confirmation  | custom      | Signature pad, dynamic rows    |

## üìù Example TypeScript Structure

> **Field Key Naming:**
>
> - All field keys are stored in snake_case in the database and mapped to camelCase in TypeScript interfaces using a mapping utility (see project-standards.md).

```typescript
interface FLRAFormInstance {
  // --- Metadata (system-managed) ---
  id: string;
  formDefinitionId: string;
  formDefinitionVersion: number;
  status: 'active' | 'archived';
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  createdBy: string;
  updatedBy: string;
  // ...other metadata fields

  // --- Form Data ---
  modules: {
    generalInformation: {
      projectName: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
      taskLocation: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
      supervisorName: {
        value: string;
        helperText1: string;
        helperText2: string;
      };
      supervisorContact: {
        value: string;
        helperText1: string;
        helperText2: string;
      };
      todaysDate: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
      crewMembers: {
        value: string | number;
        helperText1: string;
        helperText2: string;
      };
      todaysTask: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
      startTime: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
      endTime: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
    };
    preJobChecklist: {
      [field: string]: {
        value: boolean;
        helperText1: string;
        helperText2: string;
      };
    };
    ppeAndPlatform: {
      [field: string]: {
        value: boolean;
        helperText1: string;
        helperText2: string;
      };
    };
    taskHazardControl: {
      entries: Array<{
        task: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
        hazard: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
        hazardRisk: { value: number; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
        control: { value: string; helperText1: string; helperText2: string };
        controlRisk: {
          value: number;
          helperText1: string;
          helperText2: string;
        };
      }>;
    };
    photos: Array<string>; // Array of form_photos.id references
    signatures: Array<string>; // Array of form_signatures.id references
  };
}
```

> **Storage Architecture Note:**
>
> Photos and signatures are stored in separate database tables (`form_photos`, `form_signatures`) with files in Supabase Storage. The form JSONB only contains array references (UUIDs) to these records. This architecture ensures:
>
> - **Optimal Performance**: Large binary data doesn't bloat JSONB queries
> - **Proper File Management**: Direct Supabase Storage integration
> - **Audit Compliance**: Immutable signature records for legal requirements
> - **Scalability**: Independent scaling of file storage and form data

---

## ‚úÖ Validation & Completion Rules

- **NO SIGNATURES REQUIRED for form submission.** All fields including signatures are optional for maximum flexibility.
- UI/UX will encourage completion via progress tracker, guided mode, and helper texts, but nothing blocks submission.
- General Information fields are autofilled from user profile where possible.
- Every field must include `helperText1` and `helperText2` for tooltips/guided mode.
- For all date/time fields, specify the expected format in helperText2.

---

## üìã Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Implement all modules as described above.
- [ ] Use the versioning and metadata standards from the main plan.
- [ ] Implement optional signature capture with separate table storage.
- [ ] Add `helperText1` and `helperText2` to every field in the schema.
- [ ] Integrate photo and signature modules per their specifications.
- [ ] Ensure all user input is sanitized (see security section).
- [ ] Test for mobile, tablet, and desktop usability.

**This definition is implementation-ready and should be used as the canonical reference for the FLRA form.**

> **Note:** The UI should use `helperText1` and `helperText2` for tooltips, info icons, and guided mode prompts for every field. Both helperText1 and helperText2 must be accessible to screen readers, either by being visible or included in `aria-describedby`.
