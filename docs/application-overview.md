# Application Overview

HrdHat lets users sign up, create, and manage daily safety forms ‚Äî chiefly the FLRA (Field-Level Risk Assessment).

We have a form structure and every form is built of form modules(sections).

## üîß **CRITICAL: Dynamic Form Architecture**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: HrdHat uses DYNAMIC MODULE ASSEMBLY, not dynamic field creation**

### **What "Dynamic" Means in HrdHat:**

- ‚úÖ **Module Assembly**: Forms are built by combining predefined modules
- ‚úÖ **Module Selection**: Phase 2 allows users to choose which modules to include
- ‚úÖ **Array Content**: Some modules have dynamic arrays (Task/Hazard entries, signatures, photos)

### **What "Dynamic" Does NOT Mean:**

- ‚ùå **Field Creation**: Fields within modules are hardcoded TypeScript interfaces
- ‚ùå **Schema Validation**: No Zod needed - validation is module-specific functions
- ‚ùå **Runtime Field Definition**: No user-created custom fields

**Validation Strategy**: Loosely enforced - fields recommended but not required. Guided mode prompts, Quick mode allows blanks. Backend accepts incomplete forms.

There are Two primary ways to fill out an FLRA in HrdHat:

    Guided Mode

        One question per screen

        Smooth "click-in" transitions between fields

        Ideal for step-by-step focus

    Quick View

        Multiple rows/questions on a single scrollable page

        No columns‚Äîjust a vertical list

        Faster "all-at-once" fill experience

## Progress Tracking

HrdHat includes a **right-side progress tracker** that shows module completion status:

- **Mobile**: Floating 40px tracker with completion indicators (‚úì ‚óã ‚óè)
- **Tablet/Desktop**: Expanded 300px panel with module names and progress bars
- **Psychology**: Designed to make incomplete forms feel "unfinished" to encourage completion
- **Navigation**: Tap any module indicator to jump directly to that section

## Data model

The application contains the following models:

- User - can have one of these roles:

  - `USER` - can:
    - edit own profile
    - create/fill out/access/stave/submit Forms:
      - Create
      - Fill out
      - Access Active and Archived form
      - Modify Active Forms
      - Generate Pdf
      - Modify what modules a user wants in there forms.
    - edit what modules are part of what form. (This is a phase 2)

## Get Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed
2. **Installation**: Clone the repository and install dependencies
3. **Configuration**: Set up your environment variables (see Configuration section in README)
4. **Development**: Run the development server
