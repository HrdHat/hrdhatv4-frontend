# Daily Log — 2025-06-04 (Wednesday)

**Initial Goal:**
Set up and document the foundational architecture for HrdHat v4, including project structure, TypeScript configuration, and development workflow.

**Chapter Focus:** Project Setup & Architecture

---

### 13:12 — Project Setup & Architecture

- Started daily log and reviewed initial project setup steps. Confirmed focus on folder structure, TypeScript, and workflow documentation.

### 13:47 — Git Policy & Branch Setup

- Tested the explicit daily log rule to ensure notes are always written to the correct directory. Confirmed log creation and update workflow.

### 14:07:15 — Route Implementation Audit

- Completed a full audit of all main route implementations as per the development checklist.
- Marked Dashboard, FormEditor, Guided mode, ArchivedForms, Profile, and Auth routes as complete with evidence in the documentation.
- Confirmed all required route components exist and are properly routed in the application.

### 14:14:52 — Navigation & Responsive Layout Audit

- **Comprehensive audit of navigation components for each breakpoint (mobile, tablet, desktop) as specified in project documentation.**
- The documentation is thorough: it clearly defines navigation patterns and layouts for each breakpoint, including sliding sidebar and bottom drawer for mobile, persistent sidebar for tablet/desktop, and a responsive progress tracker. Visual diagrams, CSS class names, and behavioral requirements are all present in the docs.
- However, a full codebase search found no direct evidence of implemented navigation components (such as Sidebar, Drawer, BottomNav, or responsive logic using hooks or CSS-in-JS). There are no surfaced files or code snippets showing breakpoint-based rendering or adaptation for navigation components.
- The progress tracker's responsive styles are documented, but not confirmed as implemented in code. No hooks or logic for breakpoint detection were found in navigation-related components.
- **Conclusion:** Documentation is complete and clear, but the actual implementation of responsive navigation components is missing or not surfaced. Next steps should include either surfacing existing code or planning/building the required navigation components for each breakpoint as per the documented requirements.
- **Questions for the team:** Are any navigation components implemented but not surfaced in the search? Is there any responsive logic in place for navigation, or should a new implementation plan be drafted?

### 14:26:48 — Navigation Checklist Migration & Markdown Syntax

- Migrated the navigation component checklist items from Chapter 1 (02-development-checklist.md) to Chapter 3 (Core UI Components & Design System) in appplansteps.md. This aligns navigation and responsive layout work with the design system and UI component development, as these are core UI deliverables.
- Updated the checklist in Chapter 1 to reference the move, and ensured Chapter 3 now explicitly tracks navigation and responsive layout implementation for all breakpoints. This improves traceability and keeps the project plan organized by responsibility.
- Discussed and clarified the use of Markdown strikethrough syntax (`~~text~~`) for crossing out checklist items or text, ensuring future documentation edits are clear and visually consistent.
- These changes help maintain a clean separation of concerns in the documentation and make it easier to audit progress on UI/UX deliverables.

### 15:09:10 — Form Analysis & Module Definition

- Documented the distinction between **Simple** and **Complex** modules in the form-plan README, clarifying that Simple modules use standard rendering while Complex modules require custom logic or integration (e.g., user profile, metadata, dynamic arrays).
- Outlined the purpose of the form-plan folder: to centralize all documentation on form operation, user-specific loading, logic, and field definitions for all modules.
