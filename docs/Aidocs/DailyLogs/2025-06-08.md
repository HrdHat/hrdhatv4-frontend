**Branch**: sandbox-chapter-1  
**Focus**: Backend Database Migrations

## 21:18:02 - Chapter 01.5.2: Backend Setup - Migration 003 Completed

Successfully applied migration `003_seed_default_flra_template.sql` using Supabase MCP client. The FLRA stock template is now seeded in the database with all 6 modules (generalInformation, preJobChecklist, ppeAndPlatform, taskHazardControl, photos, signatures) and ready for user template forking. Migration documentation updated following proper migration rules.

## 21:25:00 - Chapter 01.5.2: Backend Setup - Automatic User Initialization System Deployed

Implemented complete automatic user initialization system including Migration 004 (database functions), user-initialization Edge Function, and comprehensive documentation. System now automatically creates user profiles and forks stock FLRA templates when new accounts are created, eliminating manual setup steps and enabling immediate form creation capability.

## 21:52:48 - Chapter 01.5.2: Backend Setup - Database Trigger System Implemented

Replaced Edge Function webhook approach with database-level trigger for user initialization. Created automatic trigger `trigger_auto_initialize_user` that fires on `auth.users` INSERT, ensuring 100% reliable user profile and FLRA template creation without external dependencies. Also implemented system user (`system@hrdhat.internal`) for database integrity, allowing safe deletion of all users while preserving stock templates. System now fully automated at database level.

## 22:16:49 - Chapter 01.5.2: Backend Setup - Auth Hook Security Investigation & Edge Function Alternative

Investigated security vulnerabilities of database trigger approach granting permissions to `supabase_auth_admin`. Researched Supabase auth hooks using Context7 MCP integration and deployed secure Edge Function alternative (`user-initialization`) for user setup. Demonstrated step-by-step auth hook technology including webhook verification, function deployment, and testing methodology. Edge Function provides secure, isolated, and auditable user initialization without compromising database permissions.

## 22:33:16 - Chapter 01.5.2: Backend Setup - Template Copy Strategy Discussion & Planning Hold

Discussed changing approach from automatic user initialization to on-demand template copying during form creation. User correctly rejected premature implementation and requested thorough review of all steps before proceeding. New approach would trigger template copying only when users actually create forms, avoiding unnecessary auth hook complexity. Need to carefully plan implementation steps before moving forward with this cleaner, more efficient strategy.

## 22:40:06 - Chapter 01.5.2: Backend Setup - Committing Research & Daily Log Updates

Committing daily log updates and research findings on template copy strategy discussion. Documentation updated to reflect the decision to pause implementation and plan more thoroughly before proceeding with form-creation-triggered template copying approach.

---

**Daily Summary**: Backend database structure now complete with database-triggered user initialization, system user architecture, and FLRA stock template system ready for frontend integration. Discussion held on form-creation-triggered template copying approach requiring careful planning before implementation.
