## 2025-06-11 13:27:13 — Logout Routing Fix

**Title:** Logout Button Now Redirects Properly

Resolved an issue where the logout button did not redirect users after logging out, causing a 404 if they were on a protected route. The handler now awaits logout and navigates to the root route ('/'), ensuring a smooth transition to the logged-out state.

## 2025-06-11 13:51:58 — New FLRA Creation Bug Fix

**Title:** Guard Clause Blocking `/form/new` Initialization

Using hints from yesterday's log (Form Initialization Guard Refactor), traced the silent failure of "Create New FLRA" to a guard that skipped initialization when `id` was undefined. Adjusted condition to skip only when `id` is truthy and already processed, restoring form creation flow. Daily log helped narrow focus to the guard refactor quickly.

## 2025-06-11 14:07:04 — Absolute Imports Enforcement

**Title:** Path Alias Added & Relative Parent Imports Banned

Set up `@/*` alias in `tsconfig.node.json` and updated ESLint (`import/no-relative-parent-imports`) to prevent `../` paths. This completes the absolute-import configuration across the codebase.

## 2025-06-11 14:17:05 — Chapter 1: Root Provider Refactor

Implemented `AppProvider` wrapper to consolidate global providers and decoupled `BrowserRouter` from `AppRoutes`. Updated `App` and `router` accordingly; pushed to `sandbox-chapter-1`.
