# Daily Log — 2025-06-05 (Thursday)

**Initial Goal:**
Continue tightening the form versioning, validation, and architecture plan for HrdHat v4, addressing remaining nitpicks and edge cases.

---

### 10:02 — Chapter 3.5/5.5: Versioning & Validation Architecture Review

- Reviewed and answered all remaining nitpicks on form versioning, JSONB indexing, validation schema, audit, and UI surfacing of metadata.
- Decided to add a simple health-check for query times, minimal backend JSON shape assertion, and runtime guards for missing fields in the renderer.
- Confirmed that only major/structural version bumps are exposed to users, with label/UX tweaks staged as drafts.
- Noted future plans for GIN indexing, field-level audit logs, and migration scripts for field renames.
- All answers and decisions are documented in form-plan/README.md for team reference.

### 10:54 — FLRA Form Schema Tightening & HelperText Standardization

- Finalized the FLRA form definition with explicit helperText1/helperText2 for every field, clarified required fields (especially supervisor signature), enforced snake_case/camelCase mapping, and fully enumerated photo/signature fields. Ensured all changes are implementation-ready and accessible.

### 21:42 — Chapter 1.5.2: Database Schema Phase 1 Implementation Complete

- Completed comprehensive review and fixes of the initial database migration (001_initial_schema.sql). Identified and resolved 10 critical issues including broken versioning architecture, missing triggers, inadequate RLS policies, and performance gaps.
- Simplified schema for Phase 1: removed supervisor/admin complexity, implemented creator-only access patterns, kept role column for Phase 2, and documented design decisions for form number flexibility and template immutability.
- Schema now properly implements documented requirements with correct versioning (template_id + version), auto-generated form numbers, required indexes for performance goals, and comprehensive data integrity checks. Ready for Phase 1 implementation.
