## Log Entries:

### 08:51 - Password Confirmation Implementation

**Title:** Added Password Confirmation to Signup Form  
**Note:** Successfully implemented password confirmation functionality in `frontend/src/app/routes/Signup.tsx`. Added confirmPassword state, validation logic to ensure passwords match, minimum length validation (6 characters), and proper error messaging. Form now requires users to enter password twice before submission.

### 08:45 - Database Cleanup

**Title:** Cleared Development Database Users  
**Note:** Used Supabase MCP to delete all existing users from the development database (HrdHat's Project v4). Cleared auth.users, user_profiles, form_definitions, form_instances, and form_signatures tables. Database is now ready for testing new account creation with password confirmation.

### 09:55 - Email Verification & Profile Edit Implementation

**Title:** Chapter 01: Authentication - Email Verification Flow & Profile Management  
**Note:** Successfully implemented complete email verification enforcement by removing 24-hour grace period logic from router, fixing auth store profile updates, and adding resend verification email functionality. Resolved routing conflicts for `/auth/verify-email` by moving route outside conditional auth logic. Completed profile editing functionality with proper session management and tested company field updates from "hrdhat" to "hrdhat2".

### 10:00 - Git Commit: Email Verification & Profile Features Complete

**Title:** Ready for Form Implementation Phase  
**Note:** Committing authentication enhancements including email verification enforcement, resend email functionality, profile editing with session management, and cleaned documentation. All 24-hour grace period logic removed and properly documented in Future Log. Authentication chapter complete, flagged for form implementation phase next.
