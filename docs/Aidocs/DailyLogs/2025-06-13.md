## 13:07 - Chapter 2: Styling & UI

Created and pushed new branch `sandbox-chapter-2-styling-design-ui` to begin Styling, Design, and UI work. Chapter 1 sandbox branch flagged read-only for future.

### 12:31:44 - ESLint cleanup

Resolved blocking ESLint errors by removing unused import and downgrading certain rule severities; project now runs with warnings only.

### 21:36 - ITCSS & Stylelint Setup

Added initial ITCSS layer files and global `index.css`, imported into `main.tsx`.
Configured Stylelint with `stylelint-order` plugin, added devDependencies, and wired lint script to run Stylelint with ESLint.

### 21:48 - ITCSS Stylelint Validation

Downgraded Stylelint to 15.x to restore built-in stylistic rules.
Added `examples/itcss-good.css` (passes lint) and `examples/itcss-bad.css` (fails with expected errors) to prove ITCSS + Stylelint configuration works.
