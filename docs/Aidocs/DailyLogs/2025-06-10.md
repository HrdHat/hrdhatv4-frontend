## 10:04:35 — Backend Migration & Error Audit

- **Chapter:** Backend Schema & Error Handling

  - Audited backend and frontend for direct REST API calls; confirmed all data access uses the Supabase JS client.
  - Investigated 406 errors; determined they are caused by unauthenticated manual or external requests, not by application code. No code changes required.
