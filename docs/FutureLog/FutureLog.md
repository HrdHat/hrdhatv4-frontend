**User Value**: Proactive sync reduces conflicts and improves reliability
**Status**: Idea

## Feature: Sync Analytics Dashboard

**Priority**: Low
**Target Phase**: Phase 3
**Description**: Monitor sync performance, conflict rates, and data loss metrics
**User Value**: Helps optimize sync strategy and identify problem areas
**Status**: Idea

## Feature: Advanced Conflict Prevention

**Priority**: Medium
**Target Phase**: Phase 3
**Description**: Lock form sections being edited to prevent conflicts before they occur
**User Value**: Reduces conflicts and user confusion during device switching
**Status**: Idea

## Feature: 24-Hour Email Verification Grace Period

**Priority**: Medium  
**Target Phase**: Phase 3  
**Description**: Allow users to use the application for 24 hours without email verification, then enforce verification requirement. Would require custom Edge Function logic to bypass Supabase's native email confirmation requirement during the grace period.
**User Value**: Improves initial user experience by allowing immediate app usage while maintaining security.
**Status**: Deferred - Standard email verification implemented instead

## Feature: Backend Enforcement for Unverified Users

**Priority**: High  
**Target Phase**: Next  
**Description**: Enforce email verification at the backend level using Supabase RLS or Edge Functions to prevent unverified users from accessing protected data or actions.
**User Value**: Ensures true security and compliance, closing the gap left by frontend-only enforcement.
**Status**: Pending

## Feature: Resend Verification Email Button

**Priority**: Medium  
**Target Phase**: Next  
**Description**: Add a button to the VerifyEmail page to allow users to resend the verification email if needed.
**User Value**: Improves user experience and reduces support requests for lost/expired verification emails.
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - Implemented with loading states, success/error messaging, and proper UX

## Feature: Full Protected Route Wiring

**Priority**: Medium  
**Target Phase**: Next  
**Description**: Complete the wiring of all protected routes in the router, ensuring only authenticated and verified users can access sensitive pages.
**User Value**: Prevents unauthorized access and improves app reliability.
**Status**: Pending

## [Planned] Route Guards for Auth-Protected Routes

- Implement route guards to restrict access to certain routes (e.g., dashboard, forms, profile) to authenticated users only.
- Use a wrapper component (e.g., <RequireAuth>) to check authentication state and redirect to /login if not authenticated.
- Ensure this is done in accordance with project standards and after team review.
- Not required for current phase; scheduled for future implementation.

### [2025-06-04] Form Metadata Phase 2 Planning

- Organization ID, Project ID, and Submission Timestamp will be added as optional metadata fields in Phase 2 for forms. These are not required in the initial implementation. See form-plan/README.md for details.
